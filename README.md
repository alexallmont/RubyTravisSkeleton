# Ruby skeleton project with rspec and travis CI

This is a bare-bones ruby project that runs a single test in rspec. It is configured for travis continuous integration.

The motivation for this was to have a clean template to work from after experiencing problems setting up travis with rspec. I had gone through various tutorials and docs for Rakefiles, Gemfiles and various config files and found it pretty overwhelming to assimilate all at once. This is a no-frills implementation.

This is mostly based on this blog post by Pete Hamilton:
